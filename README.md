# rclone-replicate

Really simple repo, nothing much to see.

Allows you to create a rclone scheduled task

# Usage
Copy `crontab.cron.example` and `rclone.conf.example` to `crontab.cron` and `rclone.conf`

You can use environment variables in `rclone.conf`, which will be substituted on container startup
